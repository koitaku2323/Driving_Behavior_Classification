Response Variable: 

- `Class`: A categorical variable (factor) indicating the driving behavior classification, which includes categories such as SLOW, NORMAL, and AGGRESSIVE.

Predictor Variables:

- `AccX`: A numerical variable representing acceleration along the X-axis in meters per second squared (m/s²).
- `AccY`: A numerical variable representing acceleration along the Y-axis in meters per second squared (m/s²).
- `AccZ`: A numerical variable representing acceleration along the Z-axis in meters per second squared (m/s²).
- `GyroX`: A numerical variable representing rotation along the X-axis in degrees per second (°/s).
- `GyroY`: A numerical variable representing rotation along the Y-axis in degrees per second (°/s).
- `GyroZ`: A numerical variable representing rotation along the Z-axis in degrees per second (°/s).

Variables not used in prediction:

- `Timestamp`: An integer variable representing time in seconds.
